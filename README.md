<h1>Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms on Tabular Data for Analyzing Well-Logs</h1>

This repository includes the code developed in my research project "Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms on Tabular Data for Analyzing Well-Logs" for completion of the Computational Sciences and Engineering, and Scientific Computing and Data Science Certificates at the University of Texas at Austin.
The research was led and supervised by Dr. Sergey Fomel.

The code was developed from an existing Jupyter notebook from the SPWLA 2020 Petrophysical Data-Driven Analytics Contest. The work uses Python packages such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and numpy. The project aims to determine the most robust method for predicting DTC and DTS given the provided well-log data.
